## Email Body

You're in.

Thanks for joining the Reset Your Aussie waitlist.

If you found this page, I'm guessing life with your Aussie feels overwhelming right now.

The constant barking. The pulling on every walk. The way they never seem to settle no matter how much exercise or training you've already done.

I get it.

I've lived it with Maddie and Maeve—both intense, always-on Australian Shepherds who taught me more than any certification ever could.

**Here's what I know about Aussie owners:**

You love your dog deeply.

You've already tried so much.

And you're exhausted from feeling like you're doing it wrong.

But you're not failing.

You and your Aussie just need support that actually fits real life—not another generic obedience class or one-size-fits-all training plan that doesn't understand what living with a herding dog is really like.

**That's why I created Reset Your Aussie.**

It's a monthly membership built for overwhelmed Aussie owners who want guidance, community, and practical steps that make everyday life easier.

When we open enrollment, you'll get:

• Simple monthly challenges to help you understand your Aussie better
• Management strategies that calm the chaos (not just add more commands)
• Live Q&A where you can ask me anything
• A community of people who get what living with an Aussie is really like
• Access to deeper programs when you're ready

I'm still putting the final pieces together, but I wanted you to be the first to know when doors open.

In the meantime, keep showing up for your dog.

Even on the hard days.

Every walk, every small moment of calm, every time you choose patience over frustration—it all builds toward something better.

I'll be back in touch soon.

— Laura

P.S. If you want to see what we're working on (or just need some encouragement), follow along on Instagram @droptheleashdogs. You'll see Maeve and me figuring it out in real time—chaos, progress, and all.
