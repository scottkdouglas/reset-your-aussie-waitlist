# Landing Page Build Instructions

Use the copywriting skill and frontend-design plugin together to create a high-converting landing page for Pam's Dog Recall Course.

## Core Requirements:

The page should:
- Write ALL copy in Laura's authentic voice using her voice skill as necessary
- Create a distinctive, warm design that builds trust (avoid generic AI aesthetics)
- Be mobile-optimized and fast-loading
- Utilize the image file DTL-Logo-TransparentBG.png as the logo

The copy should address dog owners' noted challenges with Aussie's from the Reset Your Aussie Brief.md file, and position the membership as the practical, proven solution. The design should feel professional but approachable - like Laura herself.

## Utilize the following WaitList Landing Page Prompt as much as possible for structure and other resources:

**Role:** You are a Conversion Copywriter and Web Designer specializing in community memberships and education.

**Goal:** Create a warm, high-converting Waitlist Landing Page for a "Dog Training Membership & Community."

**Tone:** Empathetic, Authoritative, Encouraging, and Warm. (Not "techy" or "hype-driven").

**Key Sections to Generate:**
1.  **Hero Section:**
    *   **Headline:** Focus on moving from frustration (barking/biting) to peace.
    *   **Lead Magnet Offer:** "Join the waitlist and immediately get our free [Insert Guide Name] PDF."
    *   **Form:** Email input + "Dog's Name" (to build emotional connection).
2.  **The "Founding Member" Offer:** A section explaining that waitlist members get "Lifetime locked-in pricing" and "Direct access to the trainer."
3.  **The Guide:** A placeholder section for the Trainer's bio and photo.
4.  **Social Proof:** A section for 3 testimonials. "What owners are saying."

**Code Requirements (Tailwind CSS):**
1.  **Color Palette:** Use "Sage Green" (primary) and "Warm Sand" (background) to evoke nature and calmness. Avoid stark black/white.
2.  **Typography:** Use a Serif font for Headings (e.g., `font-serif`) to build authority/trust, and Sans-Serif for body text.
3.  **Layout:**
    *   Mobile-first.
    *   Hero section should have the image of a happy dog/owner on the right (desktop) or top (mobile).
    *   Input fields should have rounded corners (pill-shaped) to feel friendly.
4.  **Success State:** After signup, show a message: "You're in! Check your inbox for your free guide. Want a bonus? Refer a friend below."

**Output:** Provide the copy variations first, then the HTML/Tailwind code.


## Design & Structure Requirements:

**Color Direction:**
- Use warm, inviting colors (think approachable trainer, not corporate or aggressive)
- Avoid: Corporate blues/grays, harsh reds, generic purple gradients, or any gradients
- The brand colors are: #851f18, #c7942a, #ffffff

**Aesthetic Goal:**
- Should feel like Laura: professional but friendly, credible but approachable
- Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics - make it distinctive and memorable
