More than a Walk
Every day, Maeve and I head to the forest.
It’s the one non-negotiable in my day because  it makes both of us happy and puts us in a good headspace.
It wasn’t always like that.
In the beginning, our walks were chaotic. Maeve wanted to herd everything that moved  on the ground or in the air. She lunged, she barked, and as a puppy she’d take off zooming, wrapping the long line around trees (and me). At times it felt life-threatening!
There were days I wondered if we’d ever get here, if calm, connected walks were even possible for us. But we kept showing up.
It took months of consistent practice to find the focus and calm we needed. And somewhere along the way, it stopped being about how we walked and started being about who we were together instead.
Finding Our Rhythm
It’s not perfect, but Maeve and I have found what works for us. She’s on a long line with the freedom to move and sniff. She doesn’t pull because she doesn’t need to. There’s no tension between us, just a sense of give and take.
When we pass people or other dogs, I call her in close to play a game and she comes without hesitation. Then I tell her, “Go sniff,” and she’s off again.
That rhythm, that back-and-forth between freedom and being close, feels natural now. She stays calm because it’s predictable and safe for her.
The Forest Feels Different Now
When I lost Rosie, I couldn’t go to the forest.
It was too quiet. Too empty.
The forest has always been my happy place, but only when there’s a dog beside me. Their presence changes everything.  It's my reason for being there.
When Maeve came into my life, the forest started to feel like home again.
It’s different now, because Maeve is different. She’s more intense, more curious, more alive in every moment. She doesn’t fill Rosie’s space but she’s built her own.
And it’s just as good.
Not the same, not better - just good, in a way that belongs entirely to her and me.
Stronger Together
I used to tense up at the sight of another dog or person, waiting for that rush of uncertainty. But that’s gone now. We’re both confident with whatever comes our way whether it's an off-leash dog, a sudden noise or an unexpected turn.  We can handle it.
We’ve built trust.
We’ve built confidence.
We’ve built partnership.
More Than a Walk
Every good walk builds another layer of that trust, another small moment that says, “We’ve got this.”
Because it’s not just a walk:
It’s how we keep showing up.
It’s how we stay grounded.
It’s how we get stronger together.
Every walk teaches us something.

Before You Tell Your Dog to be Quiet....
No, this isn’t another “how to stop barking in three easy steps” post.
This is about questioning whether we should stop dogs from barking at all.
There are endless tips online about silencing barkers.
But almost no one asks why dogs bark in the first place.
When people call me about their barking dogs, they don’t want to know why it is happening. They just want it fixed.
They want a dog that never barks.
But here’s the thing…
Humans “bark” all day.
We talk, shout, vent, and express ourselves.
Imagine being told you couldn’t speak ever.
The frustration would be unbearable.
Yet we expect our dogs to live that way.
As someone who has owned four barky dogs, I’ve seen and heard the reactions:
“Stop it!” “No!” “Quiet!”
Somewhere along the way, barking became a bad behavior instead of what it really is.  
It’s communication.
Ironically, we bred dogs to bark.
Many working breeds were selected for it.
We needed them to alert, guide, and protect.
Now, their jobs are gone…
But the instinct remains because we never thought to install an off switch.
We even confuse our dog by telling them that  we want them to “bark  just a little bit” or bark at strangers but not friends.
How are they supposed to know the difference?
One day barking gets praise and the next day, punishment.
Most of the time, barking is our dog’s last resort.
They’ve already been trying to tell us something through body language. That they are frustrated,  fearful or stressed.  
But we miss it.
So they raise the volume.
That doesn’t mean we should accept nonstop noise.
But the answer isn’t punishment or bark collars.
We need to:
• Listen more carefully
• Figure out what’s triggering it
• Manage their environment to help them
• Teach calm alternatives using positive reinforcement
Because barking isn’t bad behaviour.
It’s communication.

Did I Cause my Dog to Be Reactive?
If you’ve ever asked yourself that question, you’re not alone. 
Many owners I work with carry a heavy dose of guilt. They wonder if they socialized their dog the wrong way, if they let something slip in training, or if they should have somehow “seen it coming.”
The truth is that reactivity is rarely about one mistake or one moment. It’s a mix of genetics, early learning experiences, health, and sometimes owners simply not being given the right information in the first place.
It’s also difficult for our dogs to adapt to our modern world which can be very restrictive for them. For thousands of years, they roamed freely and made their own choices. Now, most are clipped to a six-foot leash and expected to march politely at our side. 
Traditional training has treated this as a control problem, pushing obedience to owners instead of recognizing that dogs also need choice, confidence, and emotional support.
So if you’re blaming yourself, stop. You didn’t set out to cause reactivity. You’ve simply been working without the full picture.
The good news is that you don’t have to keep struggling. With the right tools and guidance, your dog can learn calmer responses, and you can finally enjoy walks instead of dreading them.
That’s why I created Walks that Work—a step-by-step program that gives you the plan, coaching, and support you need to go from stressful, reactive walks to calm, connected ones.

How Socializing Your Dog Could Lead to Reactivity
The word socialization has to be the most misused term in the dog world. Everyone has a different idea of what it means and many owners are confused. 
A well-known trainer once said puppies should meet a hundred dogs and people by twelve weeks. I believe that kind of pressure doesn’t help anyone.  Socialization is about quality over quantity. 
I want Maeve to be calm and confident around other dogs and people, but I don’t want her to think she has to interact with everyone she sees. 
Why? Because she’s already 40 pounds and strong. Walks simply won’t work for any of us if she is obsessively dragging me to greet every dog and person. 
At six months, her play style is also over-the-top herding dog—jumping, pushing, trying to control movement. Most dogs don’t appreciate it but she doesn’t read their signals very well.
So we don’t do meet-and-greets on walks because she doesn’t have the impulse control to interact appropriately yet.  When she sees other dogs we work on walking calmly past them while she engages in a training game with me. She’s content with that and is now a star at ignoring dogs in her Games that Train! class.
If I had let her meet every dog I’m sure she would have become obsessed with greeting the whole world.  When social dogs are suddenly restricted from greeting others on leash it often leads to leash frustration.  
Maeve’s over the top interactions could also have gotten her into trouble with an older less tolerant dog and she might have learned to be fear reactive as a result.
I don’t walk around hugging or shaking hands with every person I see—and my dog doesn’t need to leap on every dog she meets. As Maeve matures and I help her develop more impulse control I hope she’ll be able to go for walks or simply hang out with the dogs in our social circle.  
It will take time and patience and consistent practice , but that’s the type of sociability we are shooting for here.

It Only Takes a Moment.
Twelve years ago when Maddie was six months old she had some social issues with other dogs. I had been working diligently on them and it seemed she was on the fence about being okay with dogs around her.  I had enrolled her in a class with a local dog trainer and she was doing well in a small class of quiet dogs.
One night after class we went outside to watch the agility students run.  As we were watching two golden retrievers were let off their leashes to play.  The dogs immediately rolled over Maddie crushing her underneath them.  She pulled herself out from under screaming in panic.  As I scooped her up and hurried to the car I heard the owner of the facility telling everyone around that this was typical behaviour for an aggressive Aussie.  Needless to say we never went back.
From that day Maddie was extremely reactive to all other dogs even at huge distances.  It took many years and a lot of work to reduce her reactivity to the point where she could walk calmly past other dogs  without reacting but she could only so that here on our farm.  
When Maeve was 12 weeks old on her second walk in the forest she encountered a very large lab on an extendable leash. Before I could intervene he had charged her, knocked her down and wrapped the leash  around her so she couldn’t escape. She was terrified.
Fortunately Maeve was more resilient than Maddie and the incident didn’t affect her attitude towards other dogs.  But it took me several weeks to reduce her anxiety in the forest.  
Many people who reach out to me for help with their reactive dogs say the same thing:“My dog was fine—until it got charged by another dog.”
Even if the charging dog means no harm, that single moment can change everything.
For the dog on the receiving end, the world no longer feels safe. Their lives—and their owners’ lives—start to shrink emotionally and geographically. Walks are now stressful. Outings become limited to isolated areas at odd hours, just to avoid another incident.
Some dogs, like Maeve, bounce back. But many others, like Maddie, don’t. They carry the fear with them forever.
For the owner of the charging dog, that moment passes quickly and is often forgotten.
They don’t have to live with the consequences.
But the ones who do have to deal with the impact every single day.  And that just doesn’t seem right.
