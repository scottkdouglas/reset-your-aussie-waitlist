- **Practical Application**: Games are "designed to be easily practiced everywhere, for a dog that listens everywhere"[^18]
- **Skill Development Without Commands**: The approach focuses on building habits and skills through play rather than traditional obedience commands[^25]

Laura explains her philosophy in social media content: "Your dog doesn't need more commands or control. They need skills - and you need support, and a step by step plan. That's exactly what we teach here: Games That Train".[^25]
