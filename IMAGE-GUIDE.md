## Overall Photography Guidelines

### Style Consistency:
- Natural light preferred over flash
- Warm tones that match brand colors (terracotta, gold, cream)
- Real moments over posed shots
- Show emotion and connection

### What to Avoid:
- Sterile, clinical-looking training photos
- Harsh lighting or shadows
- Chaotic, overwhelming scenes
- Stock photo aesthetics
- Overly processed/filtered images

### Brand Color Integration:
When selecting images, look for natural elements that complement the brand palette:
- Warm terracotta tones (#851f18) - rust colors in Aussie coats, earth tones
- Gold accents (#c7942a) - natural lighting, blonde/red Aussie coloring
- Cream/natural backgrounds (#f8f5f0) - outdoor settings, soft backgrounds

### Emotional Triggers:
Each image should evoke:
1. **Hero:** Hope and transformation
2. **Training images:** Community and capability
3. **Laura:** Trust and expertise

## Implementation Notes

Once images are ready:
1. Place all files in the `/assets/` folder
2. Remove `style="display:none;"` from img tags in index.html
3. Delete placeholder comments if desired
4. Test page load speed (aim for under 3 seconds)
5. Verify mobile rendering (images should stack properly)

The current design has placeholders hidden with inline styles. Simply add your images to the assets folder and remove the display:none style to make them visible.

## Priority Order

If you can only get some images initially, prioritize in this order:

1. **Hero image** - Most critical for first impression
2. **Laura portrait** - Builds trust and authority
3. **Community images** - Reinforces community benefit

The page works without images (editorial text-focused design), but adding these strategic visuals will significantly increase conversion rates by building emotional connection and trust.
